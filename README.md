## Introduction

**CartiMorph Viewer (CMV)** is part of the [**CartiMorph Toolbox (CMT)**](https://github.com/YongchengYAO/CartiMorph-Toolbox) and the [**CartiMorph**](https://github.com/YongchengYAO/CartiMorph) project. It is originally a component of the CartiMorph Toolbox, designed for visualizing some intermediate and final results from CMT. Thus you need the `Results` folder from CMT. As part of CMT, the CMV can be launched directly from the UI of CMT once all computation tasks are finished. Considering the scenario where users may wish to share their results generated by CMT with collaborators, we provide this **standalone version of CMV** to help with data sharing. 

## Features
